/**
 * A [coil3.Image] carrying a full decoded [animation]. Coil's own machinery
 * treats it as a static image (drawing the first composited frame), which keeps
 * plain `AsyncImage` working everywhere; [KiteAsyncImage] detects this type in a
 * successful result and takes over playback with its own frame loop.
 *
 * [shareable] is false — the same contract as coil-gif's Android decoder — so
 * Coil skips the memory cache for animations and re-decodes from the disk cache
 * on revisit instead of holding every frame of every GIF in RAM.
