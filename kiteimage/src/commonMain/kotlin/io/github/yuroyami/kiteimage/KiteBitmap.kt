/**
 * A decoded raster image: [width] × [height] pixels, packed as non-premultiplied
 * ARGB_8888 in a row-major [argb] array (`argb[y * width + x]`, alpha in the top
 * byte). One layout for every source format — decoders normalise grayscale,
 * palette, BGR and 16-bit inputs into this on the way out, so consumers and the
 * Compose interop never branch on the source format.
 *
 * [argb] is exposed directly (not copied) so a full-screen photo doesn't pay a
 * second multi-megabyte allocation on the way to `ImageBitmap`. Treat it as
 * read-only; mutate it only if you own the instance.
